# 🏗️ Multi-Tier Architecture

## 📖 What Is a Two-Tier Architecture?

A two-tier architecture splits an application into two layers that each do one job. The first layer handles everything your users see and interact with, and the second layer stores and manages the data behind it. For your Nextcloud private cloud, these two tiers run as separate containers that talk to each other over a private Docker network.

## 🌐 The Web/Application Tier

The web/application tier is the part of the system that your users actually reach. It serves the user interface, receives HTTP requests from browsers, runs the application logic, and decides what data to ask for or save. In this project, the Nextcloud container fills this role and is the only container exposed to users, on port 8080.

## 🗄️ The Database Tier

The database tier is responsible for persistent data. It stores user accounts, login credentials, and file metadata in an organized way, and it keeps that data safe even when the web tier restarts. In this project, the MariaDB container fills this role, and it is not published to the outside world.

## 🧩 Tier Comparison

| 🧩 Tier | 🎯 Main Responsibility | 📦 Container in This Project |
|---|---|---|
| **🌐 Web/Application Tier** | This tier serves the user interface and handles every HTTP request from your users. | The Nextcloud container, which is reachable from the browser on port 8080. |
| **🗄️ Database Tier** | This tier stores user accounts, credentials, and file metadata so that data persists. | The MariaDB container, which only the Nextcloud container connects to. |

## ❓ Why Separate Them?

Keeping the web server and the database in two separate containers means your team can update, restart, or scale one without disturbing the other. It also protects your data, because the database is not exposed to the internet and only your application can talk to it. If one container fails, your team can fix just that piece instead of rebuilding your whole application.
